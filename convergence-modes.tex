\section{Introduction}

In probability theory, we use several notions of `convergence' for
a sequence of random variables.
Some of these notions are stronger than others, so it is natural to ask
exactly when one convergence implies another.
In the following definitions and results, we assume that $X$ and $(X_n)_{n \geq 1}$ are all
random variables on some complete probability space.


\section{Definitions}

Below are definitions for a few of the more
commonly-used modes of convergence.
Other notions include
almost uniform convergence

\subsection{Almost sure convergence ($a.s.$)}

$X_n \xrightarrow{a.s.} X$
if
$$\mathbb{P}(X_n \to X \text{ as } n \to \infty) = 1$$

\subsection{Convergence in probability ($\mathbb{P}$)}

$X_n \xrightarrow{\mathbb{P}} X$
if for all $\epsilon > 0$,
as $n \to \infty$,
$$\mathbb{P}(|X_n - X| > \epsilon) \to 0$$

\subsection{Convergence in distribution ($d$)}

$X_n \xrightarrow{d} X$
if for all continuous $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$,
as $n \to \infty$,
$$\mathbb{E}[f(X_n)] \to \mathbb{E}[f(X)]$$

\subsection{Convergence in $L^p$, for $1 \leq p < \infty$}

$X_n \xrightarrow{L^p} X$
if as $n \to \infty$,
$$\mathbb{E}[|X_n - X|^p] \to 0$$

\subsection{Convergence in $L^\infty$}
$X_n \xrightarrow{L^\infty} X$
if as $n \to \infty$,
$$\mathbb{E}[\|X_n - X\|_\infty] \to 0$$

\subsection{Notes on definitions}

Almost sure convergence is perhaps the most natural extension of the
familiar idea of pointwise convergence of functions.
We simply require the convergence to occur at almost every point rather
than at every point.
